# Table below was created in mySQL and was used to reformat the dates as actual date types rather than text. Utilized the substring command in SQL that splits up the columns on placement. After that I had to use TRIM to get rid of an slashes left in the dates for concating. I then CONCAT in the b subquery and tranform to a datetime using CAST in c. I then close off the subquery and leave it room for possible expansion.

# This table is used to transform the resprays into negative revenue. FOr this I used a case when statement that properly assigns respray as a negative for analysis. I then multiplied the bill amount for each customers spray. Some of the data was false so I got rid of any bill amounts that were not over 1 to get rid of 0's that were repeat with accurate data.
